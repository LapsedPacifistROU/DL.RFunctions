Deep Learning Functions
=======================

The goal of Deep Learning R Functions package is threefold

-   Provide exercise and proof of concept for my training in creating R packages.
-   Transitioning some of my knowledge in neural networks in Python to R by writing and testing functions in R.
-   Create a basic building material for future personal projects related to deep learning by creating a repository of helper functions that I build up from ground up.

Installation
------------

You can install DL.RFunctions from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LapsedPacifistROU/DL.RFunctions")
```

Roadmap
-------

I intend on starting with writing very foundational functions as a submission for my assignment, then add the more complex functions as the time permits or it becomes a necessity related to other projects.
